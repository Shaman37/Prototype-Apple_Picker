# Prototype-Apple_Picker

This project is a Unity Example Game from the book [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development, 2nd Edition](https://book.prototools.net/), by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

It is a classic arcade game prototype, inspired by the [Kaboom! game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaboom!_(video_game)).

You can play it [here!](https://shaman37.itch.io/prototype-apple-picker)
## How to play

Use your mouse to move the barrels along the X-axis to catch the falling apples. 

If an apple is caught, you get 100 score points.
If you let an apple fall to the ground you lose a life and all apples on screen are destroyed.
